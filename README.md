# 36-401 Modern Regression

Course Policies and Syllabus, Fall 2025

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students should be able to:
- Use exploratory data analysis techniques (e.g., graphical displays) to describe data, reveal pertinent phenomena for selecting statistical models, and aid in interpreting results from models to answer data-driven questions.
- Fit linear regression models based on given data and research questions, assess the validity of model assumptions, and interpret the results to provide accurate, data-driven conclusions.
- Understand and explain the mathematical theory underlying linear regression, and demonstrate deep understanding of how linear models are learned and interpreted.
- Develop comprehensive written arguments by using statistical evidence such as exploratory analysis, model fitting, and model evaluation, to answer data-driven questions. Be able to explain those findings to a general audience.
- Utilize R to implement eï¬€ective data analyses.
